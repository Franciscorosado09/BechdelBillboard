Jörg Geissner, an employee of the Munich based AVO-Bank arrives on the island of Paladiki, to check on the registered securities of a credit granted years ago by his bank. His suspicion: the registered securities - a hospital and a power generating plant - don't really exist. But the Greeks aren't stupid - they will make Geissner prove that the securities don't exist. And so a completely overwhelmed Geissner embarks on an unexpected Odyssey all by himself, against the rest of the island. His constant companion being the shrewd German-Greek gigolo Panos, who will see to it that Geissner's search for the power-plant will get him nowhere. In the meantime Paladiki's Mayor Spyros will desperately try to conjure something up, which would maybe look like a power plant, at least at night and with the help of a few drink and then some more drinks. Losing the loan would be a catastrophe for the already destitute island and would mean certain bankruptcy. A frantic race ensues on the island of Paladiki, while a decrepit sheepfold is haphazardly turned into - what might hopefully look like - a power plant, while at the same time the fastidious auditor Geissner and the freedom-loving man-about-town (or better -island) Panos get to know each other a little better and somehow also begin to like each other.",https://c8.alamy.com/comp/P4NR98/original-film-title-highway-to-hellas-english-title-highway-to-hellas-film-director-aron-lehmann-year-2015-credit-pantaleon-films-album-P4NR98.jpg,0,NULL,NULL
