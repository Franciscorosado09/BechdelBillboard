5032,Highway to Hellas,Aron Lehmann,2015,Comedy,"The Germans are coming. To snoop, pry and inspect once again, because the Greek are always under suspicion to lie, cheat and scam. And rightfully so. Jörg Geissner, an employee of the Munich based AVO-Bank arrives on the island of Paladiki, to check on the registered securities of a credit granted years ago by his bank. His suspicion: the registered securities - a hospital and a power generating plant - don't really exist. But the Greeks aren't stupid - they will make Geissner prove that the securities don't exist. And so a completely overwhelmed Geissner embarks on an unexpected Odyssey all by himself, against the rest of the island. His constant companion being the shrewd German-Greek gigolo Panos, who will see to it that Geissner's search for the power-plant will get him nowhere. In the meantime Paladiki's Mayor Spyros will desperately try to conjure something up, which would maybe look like a power plant, at least at night and with the help of a few drink and then some more drinks. Losing the loan would be a catastrophe for the already destitute island and would mean certain bankruptcy. A frantic race ensues on the island of Paladiki, while a decrepit sheepfold is haphazardly turned into - what might hopefully look like - a power plant, while at the same time the fastidious auditor Geissner and the freedom-loving man-about-town (or better -island) Panos get to know each other a little better and somehow also begin to like each other.",,0,NULL,NULL
