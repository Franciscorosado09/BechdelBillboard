        <h1 id="text">Whats the Bechdel test?</h1>
        <p>The Bechdel test also known as the Bechdelâ€“Wallace test,is a measure of the representation of women in
          fiction. According to user-edited databases and the media industry press, about half of all films meet these
          criteria. Passing or failing the test is not necessarily indicative of how well women are represented in any
          specific work. Rather, the test is used as an indicator for the active presence of women in the entire field
          of film and other fiction, and to call attention to gender inequality in fiction. </p>
