## Description 

The Bechdel Billboard is an app that allows the user to find a list of movies that pass the bechdel test and allow for our users to blog and comment on the stories that inspire them. The application uses MySql to store blog posts, users, and movie data. Current data is pulled from various sources on the internet and compiled into a CSV that has over 6,000 movies. The application features the ability to add movies and have them approved by the website admins before being added to the list. Future goals for the application include adding the ability to favorite movies on the list and have them stored in the database and accessed by the user on their user profile. For user security the application uses passport to encrypt passwords entered by the user. We hope our application adds an additional, interactive resource for users to learn more about movies empowering women through the decades.

## The Bechdel Test

In order to have a movie approved by the admins, a movie must meet this criteria:

    1. The movie has to have at least two women in it,
    2. who talk to each other,
    3. about something other than a man.
